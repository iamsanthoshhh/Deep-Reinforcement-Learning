## Dataset

Real-time and historical data on stocks, provided by Alpha Vintage. 

## Method

Deep reinforcement learning

## Installation

First start a python (Python3.7 & Pip3) virtual environment as following:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Then install all neccessary packages using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Put your own Alpha Vantage API key in the `.env` file under `/config`. To fetch data from the AlphaVantage and output to a csv file under folder data, run the following:
